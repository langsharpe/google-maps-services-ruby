## Contributing code

The goal of this gem is to follow the API and implementation of the [Python client](https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python) as much as possible. If you would like to add support for an API please consider porting the python implementation.

If you want to hack a quick fix or extension, please feel free to do so in a fork of the project. Please consider creating a [draft PR](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) so we can see what improvements the community is interested in and eventually merge them into the project.

Changes that get merged will:
* Follow the existing code style (standard.rb needs to pass)
* Add tests for any new features
* Update the documentation and readme as needed
* Add a line to the CHANGELOG.md file

To create a new pull request:
1. Fork it (https://github.com/langsharpe/google-maps-services-ruby/fork).
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`).
5. Create a new Pull Request. Change the base repository of the PR to langsharpe/google-maps-services-ruby.
